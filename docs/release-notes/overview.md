# Overview

A modern organization must be data fit. As data volumes increase, so too does the necessity and cost of maintaining data in a state that is ready for business use. To harness data for business decisions and enable artificial intelligence, it is imperative that data is reliable, of high quality, and readily accessible to data users. The need to discover content across structured and unstructured formats, both on-premises and in the cloud, is more critical than ever. Organizations must continuously monitor their data to identify trends and anomalies and maintain data hygiene in tandem with data growth.

Policies governing data lifecycle and quality must be enforced to ensure that high-quality data is available to consumers. Consequently, data users and models can efficiently locate and utilize data through the data catalog, which is essential for a modern data-driven organization.

Pentaho Data Catalog swiftly ingests, profiles, and curates both structured and unstructured data utilizing automation and machine learning. Data and metadata fingerprinting rules are employed to contextualize data in the language of the business, as documented in the business glossary. The policy manager facilitates the implementation of governance and security policies.

A robust rules engine determines quality, sensitivity, and usage patterns. Activate your metadata by leveraging Data Catalog monitoring and notification capabilities. Construct a relationship graph across business entities and terms to infuse semantic understanding into the data.

Data fingerprints are analyzed to identify potential duplicates, copies, and similarities across data stores, thereby assessing data movement, optimization, and mastering needs. Data lineage support for Open Lineage enables tracking of data as it flows through the organization, fostering trust and facilitating early-stage data quality and remediation activities.

An advanced observability stack captures popular assets, searches, and trends, enabling stewardship organizations to concentrate their efforts on pertinent data. Collaborate within the context of your data and business vocabulary to capture tribal knowledge, recommendations, and user perspectives on data assets.
